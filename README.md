# Functional HTML/JS Casio F-91W

Hi there, this repo hosts an SVG replica of the Casio F-91W's face (based on publicly available high-resolution photos and my own F-91W), as well as a basic HTML/JS webpage displaying a (semi)functional version of the watch. The vector is not 100% accurate as I didn't use official schematics to create it, but I tried my best to make it as close to the real thing as I could. The webpage currently lacks any input through buttons like the actual watch does, and it only displays the time and day/date (in 24H format).

I made this as a fun project in order to have my favorite watch as a live wallpaper using wallpaper engine, and I think it turned out great. The webpage is also available [here](https://f-91w.tony.md/), and I plan on adding more functionality over time. All hail the F-91W.
